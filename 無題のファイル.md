Please excuse my English, Iâ€™m still learning.

I noticed MTG cards are a hot topic on Japanese TV because a full MTG Beta set was found there.

Japanese appraisers say the total value is $260K(38,000,000 yen).

Also, a Black Lotus is apparently $55K(8,000,000 yen), and the nine Power 9 cards total $138K(20,100,000yen).
